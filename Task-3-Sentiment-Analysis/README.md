# Hi
Project Title: Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning ##hi##
Internship: Elite Tech Internship Program
Task Focus: Text Preprocessing, EDA, Feature Engineering & Sentiment Classification
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Overview:-
This project is part of the Elite Tech Intern program. The objective was to analyze user-generated text (tweets/posts) and classify the sentiment as either positive or negative. The task involved handling real-world text data, performing cleaning, extracting insights, and building a machine learning model to predict sentiment.

Objectives:-
Perform data cleaning and NLP-based text preprocessing
Visualize sentiment distribution and common words
Apply ML algorithms to classify sentiment
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Export model predictions and visualize results

Key Insights:-
Pefromed Exploratory Data Anlalysis
Cleaned and preprocessed noisy user text data using NLTK
Created WordClouds for both positive and negative sentiments
Used Logistic Regression to classify text into positive or negative
Achieved good model accuracy and saved predictions to CSV
Generated pie charts and wordclouds to support insights

Tools & Libraries Used:-
Pandas, NumPy – for data handling
NLTK – for text preprocessing and stemming
Scikit-learn – for model training and evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization
WordCloud – for visualizing frequent words
Jupyter Notebook – for development

Outcome:-
Successfully completed Task 3 under the internship
Built a working sentiment classifier using ML techniques
Delivered visual and predictive insights
