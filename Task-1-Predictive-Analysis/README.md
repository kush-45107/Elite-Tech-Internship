# Task 1 - Build a Machine learning model to predict outcomes based on a dataset

Project Title: Build a machine learning model (ex- regression or classification) to predict outcomes based on dataset Internship: Elite Tech Internship Program Task Focus: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering & Model Building Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Overview:- This project is part of the Elite Tech Intern program, where the primary objective was to analyze a Sales dataset and build predictive models to uncover valuable insights and patterns.

Objectives:- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing Conduct detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualize trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib Apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and R² score

Key Insights:- Identified top-performing regions and months Explored relationship between revenue and variables like advertising and store size Built and compared models for both regression and classification tasks

Tools & Libraries:- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization Scikit-learn – Machine Learning algorithms Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development

Outcome:- Successfully completed Task 1 under the internship program Delivered a data-driven solution with visual and ML-backed insights Ready for deployment/extension in real-world business analytics
